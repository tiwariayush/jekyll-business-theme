Here's an example of how generally we proceed with the frontend and backend work to create a web app:

|Step| Stage              | Frontend                                                       | Backend                                                        |
|--|------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|1.| **Planning**    | Define project goals, requirements, and user experience (UX)       | Discuss technical requirements and system architecture            |
| |                    | Create wireframes and design mockups                               | Plan API endpoints and data models                                 |
| |                    | Decide on the technology stack and frameworks                      | Determine server and database technologies                         |
|2.| **Development** | Implement user interfaces (UI) based on design mockups              | Develop server-side logic and APIs                                 |
| |                    | Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for frontend                  | Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms              |
| |                    | Incorporate responsive design and ensure cross-browser compatibility | Handle data validation and serialization                           |
| |                    | Integrate with frontend libraries and frameworks                    | Connect to the database and implement data persistence             |
|3.| **Integration** | Collaborate with the backend team to integrate frontend with APIs   | Collaborate with the frontend team to integrate with UI components |
| |                    | Conduct integration testing and resolve any issues                  | Test API functionality and ensure proper data exchange             |
| |                    | Optimize frontend performance and ensure smooth user experience     | Optimize backend performance and address any scalability concerns  |
|4.| **Testing**     | Conduct unit testing on frontend components and UI interactions     | Perform unit testing on APIs and backend functionality             |
| |                    | Conduct functional testing and ensure UI responsiveness             | Conduct integration testing to ensure frontend-backend coherence    |
| |                    | Conduct browser compatibility testing                               | Perform load testing and identify any performance bottlenecks      |
|5.| **Deployment**  | Prepare deployment packages for frontend code                       | Deploy backend code to the server and set up necessary resources   |
| |                    | Configure hosting environment and deploy frontend                   | Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines             |
| |                    | Ensure proper DNS configuration and SSL certificates               | Monitor server performance and handle any post-deployment issues   |
|6.| **Maintenance** | Provide ongoing support for UI enhancements and bug fixes            | Monitor and troubleshoot backend functionality and performance    |
| |                    | Regularly update frontend libraries and dependencies                | Apply security patches and handle database maintenance tasks       |
| |                    | Analyze user feedback and incorporate improvements                  | Collaborate on future feature enhancements and system updates      |

***Note:** The above table is a general representation of the workflow between frontend and backend teams during the development of a web app. The specific tasks and stages may vary based on project requirements and team preferences.*
