# Objectives


By leveraging the capabilities of Python, Django, and FastAPI, we offer comprehensive API integration solutions, including seamless integration, robust endpoint development, authentication, data validation, rate limiting, documentation, versioning, error handling, and logging. These features enable efficient and secure communication between systems, empowering your applications with enhanced functionality and interoperability.


## Seamless API Integration

We excel at integrating APIs into your applications, whether it's consuming external APIs or building your own API ecosystem. We ensure smooth communication and data exchange between different systems, enabling seamless integration with third-party services. 

## Robust Endpoint Development
Using Django and FastAPI, we develop robust and secure endpoints for your API. These endpoints allow clients to interact with your application, enabling data retrieval, submission, and other necessary operations.

## Authentication and Authorization

We implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect your APIs from unauthorized access. We can integrate various authentication methods such as token-based authentication, OAuth, or custom authentication based on your specific requirements.

## Data Validation and Serialization

We leverage Django and FastAPI's powerful validation and serialization features to ensure that the data exchanged through the API is valid, consistent, and properly structured. This helps in maintaining data integrity and enhancing the overall reliability of your API.

## Rate Limiting and Throttling

To prevent abuse and ensure optimal performance, we can implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms. These features help control the number of API requests made within a specific timeframe, preventing misuse and maintaining a high level of service quality.

## API Documentation

We understand the importance of clear and comprehensive API documentation. We can generate detailed documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for FastAPI or Django Rest Framework's built-in documentation tools. This enables easy adoption and usage of your API by both internal and external developers.

## Versioning and Upgrades

As your application evolves, we can assist in versioning and handling API upgrades. We ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions, minimizing disruptions and maintaining compatibility with existing integrations.

## Error Handling and Logging

We implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to track and handle errors effectively. This helps in debugging and troubleshooting API issues, providing valuable insights for continuous improvement.

## Relevance

Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance.

> The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value.

Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

## Faithful Representation

Faithful representation means that the actual effects of the transactions shall be properly accounted for and reported in the financial statements. The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error.

## Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics

### Verifiability

Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity.

### Comparability

Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.

### Understandability

Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.
Timeliness: Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.

## Statement of cash flows

The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance

| Cash Inflow | Outflow   | Opening Balance |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| _Monday_    | `Tuesday` | **Wednesday**   |
| 1           | 2         | 3               |

**Example 1:** in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:

- Cash inflow: $20
- Cash outflow:$7
- Opening balance: $5
- Closing balance: $20 â€“ $7 + $5 = $18

**Example 2:** in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:

> **Important:** the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.

## Statement of financial position (balance sheet)

The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement.

- **fixed assets**
  - property
  - building
  - equipment (such as factory machinery)
- **intangible assets**
  - copyrights
  - trademarks
  - patents
    - pending
    - international
- goodwill

Owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.
